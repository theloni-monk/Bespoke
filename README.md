# ___Bespoke___

_Bespoke_ is a system for synthesizing FPGA stream
processors from 8-bit quantized neural network specifications.
For edge ML applications, power efficiency and speed are
paramount. The system described presents an alternative to run-
ning intensive ML routines on microcontrollers, allowing for edge
systems to use cheaper and more power efficient microcontrollers
alongside a bespoke FPGA that can be dynamically reconfigured
to suit any ML stream-processing task. The model could even be
modified or tuned on the edge by the microcontroller. Suitable
applications include sensor data processing, state estimation and
control, forecasting, and decision making
